# Xulu_Deobf
This Is my shitty attempt at a xulu deobf because ele was using jobf. Minecraft mappings have been applied and it was decompiled by procyon. Some stuff is still obfuscated because the information is lost in the obf process but this is not an issue for anyone competent with java. Don't contact me for help unless I know you.
