# Xulu_Deobf
This Is my attempt at a xulu deobf because ele was using jobf. Minecraft mappings have been applied and it was decompiled by Fernflower. It is far from perfect as some of the the information is lost in the obf process but this is not an issue for anyone competent with java. Don't contact me for help unless I know you.
